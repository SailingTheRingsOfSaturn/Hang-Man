# Hang-Man
My first python game.
ASCII HANGMAN:
HOW TO PLAY

The game will generate a random word (from a collection of hundreds of words)

Every time you guess a question incorrectly the hangman gets drawn, guess incorrect 6 times and you will lose.

NOTE:
When you guess a correct letter, it may freeze/pause, simply enter the letter again and it will reverse the freeze and you can continue as normal.

Thanks for checking out my first python game :D

SOURCES:
The game was made with several youtube tutorials.
